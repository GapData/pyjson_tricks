Contributing
===============================

Contributions are very welcome! This can be done through:

* Reporting bugs (issues_)
* Suggesting features (issues_)
* Fixing bugs (`pull request`_)
* Implementing features (`pull request`_)
* Telling a friend :)

There are only few things to keep in mind:

* Discuss features in an issue before contributing code.
* Automated tests are required to go live, not necessarily to commit.
* Try to follow the `code conventions`_.
* `Be nice`_.
