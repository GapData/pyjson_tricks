Contributing
===============================

Contributions are very welcome! This can be done through:

* Reporting bugs (issues_)
* Suggesting features (issues_)
* Fixing bugs (`pull request`_)
* Implementing features (`pull request`_)
* Telling a friend :)

If you plan to contribute some code, it's recommended to make sure an issue for the bug or feature exists and has been discussed. Otherwise there is a chance that your contribution is not in line with the vision for this project, and might be rejected on that basis.

Any significant changes should be covered by automated tests before they will be made available through ``pip``. However, you may contribute features without tests if you're willing to wait for someone else to add the tests.

Other than that, the process is flexible and not unlike those at other projects. `Be nice`_ and try to follow the `code conventions`_, that's it!
